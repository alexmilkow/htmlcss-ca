Reflection

I felt really excited to be starting with HTML and CSS, and I think it is a great idea to build what we have already made in the design course. I think that the learning material provided was really good, both the written material, and the videos, walkthroughs etc. I was really frustrated when we got to flexbox and grids, because I just couldn’t wrap my head around it. But watching some tutorials and videos online made me more comfortable with it, and after the practice guitar project, and also implementing it in the CA, I now feel more confident using it correctly, and actually understanding the concept. Other than that, I felt like the material explained everything in a good manner and there is also a lot of resources online to provide us answers.
In the aftermath, I see that proper CSS class names are a big deal to finding things and to maintain the code more easily. If I would have done anything differently, I would have sat down and made a proper system for the naming, but I guess this is also something that will get better with more practice and time, and also by building more projects.
I found the workload manageable. I think the amount of work for each module was good – it was a lot of learning, but I felt that we had enough time to get to know the material, practice and implement things in our project, and also giving it time to let it sink in. I am also really glad that we had the time in the end to make sure that our site properly functions, and that everything looks as we want, so we can deliver with more satisfaction.

Some decisions made along the way

- I decided to remove the sale section I made in the design course. The image was of poor quality and didn’t look good on the web page. It also took up unessecary space as it was not a part of the task brief, and it was cluddering the page. I am happy with the result of that decision, as it looks more neat and clean.
- I also decided to remove the back button I originally made. I found the button unnecessary because you can click the back button on the device’s browser on both desktop and mobile. It also looked a bit messy, especially on mobile, because it got a bit squished together with the header of the pages.
- I needed to remove the original contrast color (brown/orange) on the contact us-page because of breach with WCAG. It looks a little plainer, but now in accordance to WCAG.
- The Wave reports I made for my pages looks good, but because of some “hacky” solutions with HTML and CSS, caused by us not using Javascript at this point, there are some flags in regard to this. For example, I get a flag concerning the label for the “add to cart” button on the Batman page. Because this is a HTML/CSS solution, I needed to leave it like it is. Also, I have chosen to ignore the “redundant link” alert, since it points to that both “Home” and clicking the logo refers to the same page (I want the user to be able to use both options).
